### What are wrapped tokens and why do I need them?

Native tokens such as: ETH on Ethereum Mainnet, xDAI on xDAI network, or Matic on Polygon are special as they're the only token accepted for transaction fees on their respective network. The DAO Smart contracts cannot hold native tokens, only ERC-20's.  So DAOs and a lot of their dapps use wrapped versions of those tokens. wETH is wrapped ETH, wxDAI is wrapped xDAI, and so on. As a wrapped token, they can be used now inside the DAO and dapps for proposals.

The folks at Raid Guild have built a no fees, no frills simple wrapper at https://wrapeth.com. You can wrap and unwrap at anytime.

If you are testing in Rinkeby and want to convert your Rinkeby ETh to weth, use Uniswap at https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=rinkeby. The Weth contract of wrapeth in rinkeby is not the right one.
