### [What is DAOhaus?](https://daohaus.club/docs#what-is-daohaus) 

DAOhaus is a no-code platform where you can create ("summon") and manage your DAO. It is owned and operated by the community. All DAOs on the platform utilize the glorious open-source code of [Moloch](/docs/users/intro-moloch). Creating a DAO only requires a few clicks and you pay zero fees–just gas!

Here's why DAO's like Meta Cartel use our platform: 
* **Treasury management:** Facilitate, monitor and disperse payments from your treasury. 
* **Governance:** Use shares to propose, review and sponsor proposals for your DAO to vote on.
* **Boosts:** Productivity apps for your DAO that enable you to automate specific tasks to improve your workflow. 
* **Minions:** Automated smart contract assistants that allow your DAO to interact with any external smart contract. 

DAOhaus enables you to focus on building your DAO while our platform helps you manage and automate administrative activities. 

### What is a DAO?
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a community of people aligned by a common goal where decision making power is distributed and resources are collectively managed. 

Here's a breakdown of what each part of a DAO means: 
* **Decentralized:** Ownership and decision making power is distributed across all members of the DAO. 
* **Autonomous:** Smart contracts (coded software) enable automation of processes that execute after a proposal is approved by DAO members 
* **Organization:** A group of people that form a community with a shared purpose and resources that are managed collectively 


### Why do DAOs matter? 
DAOs enable a new way for people to organize and develop incentives that align for all members. 


DAOs enable a new form of collective organization that aligns incentives across sovreign members of the organization, not just a small group of core people. Here are a few reasons why DAOs are significant…

- **Ownership:** Each member owns a part of the DAO which creates opportunities for shared upside and collective decision making. 
- **Shared Governance:** Any member can create a proposal that they believe will benefit the DAO, present it to members, and put it to a vote. 
- **Fluidity:** Members choose how much time they want to invest in a DAO and can move fluidly between multiple DAOs creating opportunities for cross-pollination. 

### What is Moloch?

Moloch refers to the framework or set of smart contracts underpinning DAOs operating on DAOhaus. There are a few features that one should remember when learning about Moloch DAOs.

Typically Moloch DAOs are **permissioned** meaning that in order to join one, an existing member has to invite or vouch for you through **sponsoring** and **voting** on a **member proposal**. 

Membership in a Moloch DAO is denoted through share ownership, where shares represent governance power and custody over assets held in the DAO treasury.

Loot is another type of membership in a DAO, but only represents economic claim against assets in the DAO treasury.

Moloch v2 does not support share/loot transferrability, removing the risk of individuals or bots purchasing or trading shares on a secondary market, a mechanic that was designed to reduce capture - see [Anticapture](https://mirror.xyz/hq.spengrah.eth/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)

*Note: Each DAO has it's own process for distributing shares to it's members.*

**Ragequit** is a core feature that provides share or loot holders an exercisable claim over assets held in the the DAOs main treasury. Ragequit provides minority member protection, allowing share holders to withdraw on a pro-rata basis assets held in the DAOs treasury at their own will.

There are other benefits to using ragequit. Burning shares and claiming payment for work in service of the DAO is a common example.

**Grace period** is the length of time between a proposal passing and when a proposal is ready for processing. It is set by the DAO at summoning, and it ensures that members have ample time after a proposal has passed to **ragequit**, pulling funds out of the treasury if they choose.

*Note: if your DAO is looking to keep some portion of funds protected from the ragequit feature, be sure to see the [`Safe Minion Boost`](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/boosts/minion-dev-suite-v3-boost) and other boosts we have available through Boost Marketplace*. Boosts are dapps you can add directly to yours DAO's UI.
