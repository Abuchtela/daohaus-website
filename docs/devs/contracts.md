## Moloch Version 2

> Moloch v2 is designed to extend MolochDAO's operations from purely single-token public goods grants-making to acquiring and spending (or investing in) an unlimited portfolio of assets.
>
> Proposals in Moloch v2 now specify a tribute token and a payment token, which can be any whitelisted ERC20. Membership proposals which offer tribute tokens in exchange for shares can now offer any token, possibly helping balance the DAO portfolio. Grant proposals can now be in both shares and a stablecoin payment token to smooth out volatility risk, or even skip shares entirely to pay external contractors without awarding membership. Members can also propose trades to swap tokens OTC with the guild bank, which could be used for making investments, active portfolio management, selloffs, or just to top off a stablecoin reserve used to pay for planned expenses.
>
> In addition to standard proposals above, there are two special proposals. The first is for whitelisting new tokens to be eligible as tribute, and the second is for removing DAO members via Guild Kick. Both follow the same voting mechanics as standard proposals (no quorum, simple majority rules).
