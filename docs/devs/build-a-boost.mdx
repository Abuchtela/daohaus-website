# How to Build a Boost (Mint a Million)
> This tutorial will show you to create a DAOhaus Boost that interacts with a Smart Contract

Creating a DAOhaus Boost is a way to add functionality to the [DAOhaus Interface](https://app.daohaus.club). This tutorial will show you how to create a Contract Boost. Contract Boosts enable your DAO to initiate an interaction with an external contract. See the [DAOhaus Proposal Process](../users/proposals) for more information about how proposals work in the DAOhaus app.

This "Mint a Million" Contract Boost will allow a DAO to create an ERC-20 token with 1 million supply using a [Factory Contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xe4E893AffD33dDED43ECdf8bBC550639c84485e5#code) we have supplied for you. The token will be managed by a Minion and Safe in your DAO. 

> Learn more about [Minions & Safes](../users/bank) 

# Contract Boost Overview 
To build a Contract Boost, there are 3 primary components you'll need to create: 
1. **Form:** The form used to collect data from the proposer that is needed to execute the external contract interaction.
2. **Contract:** The contract address and the Applicaton Binary Interface (ABI) provided by the contract.
3. **Transaction Schema:** The data to send to the contract when the proposal passes.

For more information on how Boosts work, refer to the [Boosts Overview page here](../users/boosts/boosts)

# Getting Started
**Before you begin,** 
* Follow these steps to clone the [daohaus-app github repo](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app) and create a branch with the format ```mint_a_million_<yourdiscordhandle>```. *Your discord handle in the branch name helps us when providing support.*
    * ```git clone https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app.git```
    * ```cd daohaus-app```
    * ```git branch mint_a_million_yourhandle```
    * ```git checkout mint_a_million_yourhandle```
    * ```touch .env```
* Open the `.env` file you just created in your root directory and add the following:
``` g
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
REACT_APP_DEV=true

REACT_APP_RPC_URI=`Your URI here` 
REACT_APP_INFURA_PROJECT_ID= `Your Infura Project ID here` 
```

From the root of your application: 
* Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
* Run `yarn start` to launch the DAOhaus app

# 1. Build your Form ([31:52](https://youtu.be/Xk1nETEvuJw?t=1912))
In this step, we will set up your Contract Boost's proposal form and fields that are required to create the proposal and execute the external contract call.

==As it stands, these tutorial branches can't be merged because there would be filename collisions==

==Question:  Actually following this tutorial will lead to duplicate files if pushed and merged. Maybe we want to modify this to add their boost to a "Tutorial Playlist" that automatically creates a token of their choosing... some modification could end up with a long list of slightly different summon token boosts, which would be pretty cool==


## 1.1 Create **[mintAMillionForms.js](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/pull/1819/files#diff-b7c92f30157b49e73f304e34c7c3d54cdd30d0908029a0b0b7fe1be85e476c3d)** in `src/data/formLegos/` for your Boost 

This file will export a single React object to generate a form for your Boost in the DAOhaus App. It is possible to create multiple forms in a file, but we will just be creating 1 form here called `SUMMON_TOKEN`

Add the following code to mintAMillionForms.js: 

```jsx title="/src/data/formLegos/mintaMillionForms.js"
import { MINION_TYPES, PROPOSAL_TYPES } from '../../utils/proposalUtils';
import { FIELD } from '../fields';
import { TX } from '../txLegos/contractTX';

export const MILLION_FORMS = {
  SUMMON_TOKEN: {
    id: 'SUMMON_TOKEN',
    title: 'Mint A Million',
    description: 'Mint a million of a new token!',
    type: PROPOSAL_TYPES.MINT_A_MILLION,    // Custom proposal types that allow you to render custom proposal UIs ??
    minionType: MINION_TYPES.SAFE,    // Selects only the "Safe Minion"
    dev: true, // Shows the Proposal on your DEV Test List for testing
    logValues: true, // Logs form values in the console  
    tx: null, // Will build this in step 2
    required: [], // Specifies required fields from the below fields
    fields: [], // Specifies fields to be shown on the form
  },
};

```

The `dev: true` will let you see your form in the 'DEV Test List' playlist - a special playlist used for testing. It will be visible only because you added *REACT_APP_DEV=true* to your *.env* file above. This allows you to access and test the proposal before it is complete. 


> Playlists are groupings of proposals that are related to one another. For instance, the DEV Test List playlist will display all the proposal types in the development environment.  


To preview your Proposal Playlist, you will need to have an existing DAO locally. If you have not already summoned a DAO, you can summon one at localhost:3000/summon

First, ```yarn start``` and Load the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Navigate to your DAO and click on **New Proposal**. Select **Manage** on the Proposal Playlist modal. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/HDK5vOx.png)

You should be able to see a Playlist called "DEV Test List" with the "Mint a Million" Proposal type. ([51:32](https://youtu.be/Xk1nETEvuJw?t=3093))

![](https://i.imgur.com/p7bkwV5.png)


## 1.2 Add a new Proposal Type in `src/utils/proposalUtils.jsx`

Add `MINT_A_MILLION: 'Mint a Million',` to the `PROPOSAL_TYPES` object in `src/utils/proposalUtils.jsx`(see line 66).

`proposalsUtils.js` is the central directory for all proposal utilities available in the DAOhaus app. This step signals to the DAOhaus App that it should consider your boost proposal as a valid proposal type.

```jsx=31 title="/src/utils/proposalUtils.jsx"
...
export const PROPOSAL_TYPES = {
  CORE: 'Core',
  MEMBER: 'Member Proposal',
  SIGNAL: 'Signal Proposal',

    ...
    
  SWAPR_STAKING: 'Swapr Staking Proposal',
  POSTER_RATIFY: 'Ratify Content',
  POSTER_RATIFY_DOC: 'Ratify DAO DOC',
  // highlight-next-line
  MINT_A_MILLION: 'Mint a Million',
};
...
```
## 1.3 Add Fields 
When creating the form, we need to create fields to collect data (i.e. Supply, Name, Symbol, Receiver) from users to initiate the [contract call](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xe4E893AffD33dDED43ECdf8bBC550639c84485e5#writeContract). 

In this form, we will include:
1. A `Select a Minion` field for DAO members to indicate the address that owns the newly minted ERC-20 tokens 
2. A `Token Name` field for the token's name (e.g `My Cool Token`)
3. A `Token Symbol` field for the token's symbol (e.g. `MCT`) 

> We will not be asking for token supply because we are hardcoding it to 1,000,000 (hence the name 'Mint a Million')

### 1.3.1 Add `FIELD.MINION.SELECT` as the first field ([49:58](https://youtu.be/Xk1nETEvuJw?t=2998))

In `mintAMillionForms.js` add a minion select field to your fields array:
```jsx
...
    fields: [
      // Specifies fields to be shown on the form
      [FIELD.MINION_SELECT],
    ],
...
```

`FIELD.MINION_SELECT` is a prebuilt form field that provides a dropdown with all of your DAO's minions. This field will give us access to the Safe Minion address, which we will need to construct our transaction in Step 3.


### 1.3.2 Create a custom field for Token Name and Symbol


Modify `mintAMillionForms.js` to add these custom fields to your fields array:
``` jsx
...
fields: [
      [
        // Specifies fields to be shown on the form
        [FIELD.MINION_SELECT],
      ],
      [
        {
          type: 'input', // Standard HTML input
          label: 'Token Name', // Renders this as form title
          name: 'tokenName', // This is how the field will be referenced across files
          htmlFor: 'tokenName',
          placeholder: 'Token Name', // Placeholder text
          expectType: 'any', // Type check (e.g. 'number')
        },
        {
          type: 'input',
          label: 'Token Symbol',
          name: 'tokenSymbol',
          htmlFor: 'tokenSymbol',
          placeholder: 'Token Symbol',
          expectType: 'any',
        },
      ],
    ],
...
```
There are many field types in the DAOhaus App that you can reuse for your form. In this case, we will create custom form fields to collect the token name and the token symbol. 

> **A Note on Form Columns:** The `fields` array includes a subarray that holds the form fields.  If your form requires multiple field columns, create subarrays (one for each column) within the `fields` array. Form elements in these separate subarrays will appear in separate columns.

For more information on Form Legos, refer to [Form Legos](./legos/form-lego-api)

==TODO ask Jord what htmlFor does in code snippet above==

### 1.3.3 Make all fields required 
For this form, we need DAO members to fill in all three fields (i.e. Select a Minion, Token Name & Token Symbol). 

Add the `name` property of each field into the `required` array. If the user does not provide these fields, the form will not be submitted. 

Your completed `mintAMillionForms.js` file should look like this. 

```jsx title="/src/data/formLegos/mintaMillionForms.js"
import { MINION_TYPES, PROPOSAL_TYPES } from '../../utils/proposalUtils';
import { FIELD } from '../fields';
import { TX } from '../txLegos/contractTX';

export const MILLION_FORMS = {
  SUMMON_TOKEN: {
    id: 'SUMMON_TOKEN',
    title: 'Mint A Million',
    description: 'Mint a million of a new token!',
    type: PROPOSAL_TYPES.MINT_A_MILLION,
    minionType: MINION_TYPES.SAFE,
    dev: true,
    logValues: true,
    tx: TX.SUMMON_TOKEN,
    // highlight-next-line
    required: ['tokenName', 'tokenSymbol', 'selectedMinion'],
    fields: [
      [
        FIELD.MINION_SELECT,
        {
          type: 'input',
          label: 'Token Name',
          name: 'tokenName',
          htmlFor: 'tokenName',
          placeholder: 'Token name',
          expectType: 'any',
        },
        {
          type: 'input',
          label: 'Token Symbol',
          name: 'tokenSymbol',
          htmlFor: 'tokenSymbol',
          placeholder: 'Token Symbol',
          expectType: 'any',
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
};

```

## 1.4 Import and add `MILLION_FORMS` object to `src/data/formLegos/forms.js`

First, import the `MILLION_FORMS` object in `forms.js`. 
Add `import { MILLION_FORMS } from './mintAMillionForms';` to the list of imports

Next add `...MILLION_FORMS` to the `FORM` object. 

`forms.js` is the central directory for all forms available in the DAOhaus app. This step imports and stores the `MILLION_FORMS` object (i.e. Mint a Million form formats) in the central directory.

```jsx title="src/data/formLegos/forms.js"
import { CLASSIC_FORMS } from './classics';

    ...

import { POSTER_FORMS } from './posterForms';
// highlight-next-line
import { MILLION_FORMS } from './mintAMillionForms'; //ADD THIS

export const FORM = {
  ...CLASSIC_FORMS,
    
    ...
    
  ...POSTER_FORMS,
  // highlight-next-line
  ...MILLION_FORMS, //AND THIS
};
```


## 1.5 Preview your form
Now that you have created your form and added it to the DAOhaus App, you can preview it in the `DEV Test List` playlist. 

To preview the form in your development environment, navigate to the `DEV Test List` by clicking on Proposals > New Proposal > Manage(Gear Icon) > DEV Test List.

> Again, you will need to have an existing DAO to preview your Proposal Playlist. If you have not already summoned a DAO, you can summon one at localhost:3000/summon
 
The test "Mint a Million" proposal is now visible in the `Dev Test List` ([51:32](https://youtu.be/Xk1nETEvuJw?t=3093)) because we set these properties:
* `dev: true` (in `mintAMillionForms.js`)
* `REACT_APP_DEV=true` (in `.env`)

# 2. Import your Contract
Now that your proposal form is ready, let's set up the contracts that your Boost will be interacting with. 

## Step 2.1: Add your contract address in `src/utils/chain.js`
The `chain.js` file stores all the contract addresses that the application needs to have access to. Contract addresses are separated by network chains (e.g. Ethereum Mainnet, Rinkeby, etc.)

Our contract exists on Rinkeby, so we will add the contract address to the Rinkeby object. The Mint a Million Contract address is `0xe4E893AffD33dDED43ECdf8bBC550639c84485e5`

Add `erc20_summon:'0xe4E893AffD33dDED43ECdf8bBC550639c84485e5',`  to the `'0x4'` (i.e. Rinkeby) object. Your field can technically be added anywhere in the object, but let's add it after the `moloch_factor_addr` in `chain.js` field to keep things organized:



``` jsx title='src/utils/chain.js'
'0x4': {
   name: 'Ethereum Rinkeby',
    short_name: 'rinkeby',
    shortNamePrefix: 'rin',
    nativeCurrency: 'ETH',
    network: 'rinkeby',
    network_id: 4,
    chain_id: '0x4',
    
        ...
    
    minion_factory_addr: '0x313F02A44089150C9ff7011D4e87b52404A914A9',
    moloch_factory_addr: '0xC33a4EfecB11D2cAD8E7d8d2a6b5E7FEacCC521d',
    //highlight-next-line
    erc20_summon: '0xe4E893AffD33dDED43ECdf8bBC550639c84485e5', // Our contract address
        
        ...
}
```

## 2.2 Create a new object in `src/data/contracts.js`

Open `src/data/contract.js` and add the following `ERC_20_SUMMON` object to the CONTRACTS object:

``` jsx title='src/data/contract.js'
export const CONTRACTS = {

    ...
    
  ERC_20_SUMMON: {
    location: 'local',
    abiName: 'ERC_20_SUMMON',
    //highlight-next-line
    contractAddress: '.contextData.chainConfig.erc20_summon',
  },
    
    ...
}
```

> The DAOhaus app uses a `.` search notation to point to data / properties within objects in the codebase. For instance, the `contractAddress: '.contextData.chainConfig.erc20_summon',` will point to the `erc20_summon` property within the `chainConfig` object that you added in Step 2.1 above



## 2.3 Create [erc20Summon.json](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/pull/1819/files#diff-f2074041d89d84186ebb17c25d819247a85a04a7cce7cfefde67b9f4700e3eee) in `src/contracts` ([1:07:33](https://youtu.be/Xk1nETEvuJw?t=4053))

## 2.4 Add contract ABIs to `erc20Summon.json`
First, navigate to the [Mint a Million contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xe4E893AffD33dDED43ECdf8bBC550639c84485e5#code) on Etherscan. 

Next, copy and paste the ABIs for this contract by clicking the 'Copy All to clipboard' button in the Contract ABI section. Paste the Contract ABI into erc20Summon.json

![](https://i.imgur.com/Znp7wuA.png)

These ABIs will be used by the DAOhaus app when creating a transaction and interacting with the smart contract's available functions. 

## 2.5 Import the contract ABIs into `src/utils/abi.js` ([1:08:10](https://youtu.be/Xk1nETEvuJw?t=4090))

The `abi.json` file is a central directory of all contract ABIs which the DAOhaus app will interact with. This step imports and stores the `ERC_20_SUMMON` object (i.e. Mint a Million Factory contract ABIs) into the central directory.

Open `src/utils/abi.js` and add the following 2 lines:

`import ERC_20_SUMMON from '../contracts/erc20Summon.json'`

`ERC_20_SUMMON,`

The resulting file should look something like this: 
``` jsx title='src/utils/abi.js'
import { encodeMultiSend } from '@gnosis.pm/safe-contracts';
import Web3 from 'web3';
import { Contract, BigNumber } from 'ethers';
    ...
import MOLOCH_TOKEN_FACTORY from '../contracts/molochTokenFactory.json';
//highlight-next-line
import ERC_20_SUMMON from '../contracts/erc20Summon.json' // ADD THIS
    ...
    
export const LOCAL_ABI = Object.freeze({
  MOLOCH_V2,
  ERC_20,
  VANILLA_MINION,
    ...
  MOLOCH_TOKEN_FACTORY,
  //highlight-next-line
  ERC_20_SUMMON,  // AND THIS
    ...
```

Verify that the `ERC_20_SUMMON` property matches in both `src/utils/abi.js` and `src/data/contracts.js`

## 2.6 Create a new Proposal Type in `src/data/details.js`

Add the following code to the `DETAILS` object

``` jsx title='src/data/details.js'
  MILLION: {
    title: `Mint a Million!!!`,
    proposalType: '.formData.type',
  },
```

The `title` object will determine the Proposal title on the Proposal Card within the DAOhaus app. 

The `proposalType` object will reference the proposal type, which appears in different places in the DAOhaus UI. `.formData.type` references the fields you added to `src/utils/proposalUtils.jsx` earlier in the tutorial.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/c176gwk.png)


At the end of this step, you have done the necessary set up for your contracts within the DAOhaus app. The next step will be to build and test your transaction!


# 3. Build your Transaction 

## 3.1 Create `millionTx.js` in `src/data/txLegos` ([1:11:45](https://youtu.be/Xk1nETEvuJw?t=4305))

First, create a new file called `millionTx.js` in `src/data/txLegos`

Next, add the following code into the `MILLION_TX` object.

==Is it the case that this matches the SUMMON_TOKEN we put in the form above? These details will be important when people want to make their own custom boost==

```jsx title='src/data/txLegos'
import { buildMultiTxAction } from '../../utils/legos';
import { CONTRACTS } from '../contracts';

export const MILLION_TX = {
  SUMMON_TOKEN: buildMultiTxAction({
    actions: [
      {
        targetContract: '.contextData.chainConfig.erc20_summon', // Location for Contract Address (Added in the previous step)
        abi: CONTRACTS.ERC_20_SUMMON, // Contract ABI (Added in the previous step)
        fnName: 'summonToken', // Function name in ABI
        args: [],
      },
    ],
  }),
};

```

## 3.2 Add your transaction arguments 

Recall that we pasted these fields into the `erc20Summon.json` file after copying them from the Contract ABI section on Etherscan:
```json title='src/contracts/erc20Summon.json'
"inputs": [
  { "internalType": "uint256", "name": "supply", "type": "uint256" },
  { "internalType": "string", "name": "name", "type": "string" },
  { "internalType": "string", "name": "symbol", "type": "string" },
  { "internalType": "address", "name": "receiver", "type": "address" }
```


In our new file `millionTx.js` we need to specify the arguments for the transaction in the same order as they are defined by the Contract ABI. 

Add the following arguments to the `args` property in `millionTx.js`:

```jsx title='src/data/txLegos/millionTX.js'
args: [
  '1000000000000000000000000', // Supply (Hardcoded to 1 million in Gwei)
  '.values.tokenName', // Token Name
  '.values.tokenSymbol', // Token Symbol
  '.values.selectedSafeAddress', // Safe Address as the owner
],
```

The first argument above is a hardcoded value of 1000000000000000000000000  (i.e. 1,000,000 in Gwei) to automatically mint a million tokens. 

The remaining arguments will be provided by the user through form inputs. The DAOhaus app uses React Hooks in its forms, returning form inputs in an object called `values`. 

In the example above, we used dot notation to extract the values provided by the users of the form for the next three arguments (i.e. Token Name, Token Symbol and Selected Safe Address). Selected Safe Address is made available by the MINION_SELECT form field we specified in step 1.3.1

When building the transaction, the above values will be submitted as a part of the transaction. This will mint 1,000,000 tokens with `tokenName` and `tokenSymbol` specified by the user, specificing the Minion Safe `selectedSafeAddress` as the owner.

## 3.3 Add the proposal's `detailstoJSON` reference

Import the `DETAILS` object into `millionTX.js`:

```jsx
import { DETAILS } from '../details';
```

Add the following property to the `SUMMON_TOKEN` object:

``` jsx 
detailstoJSON: DETAILS.MILLION,
```

The detailstoJSON property refers to the object added to `details.js` (Step 2.6) which contains all proposal details required for rendering proposals (e.g. title, description, etc.)

At the end of this step, your code in `millionTX.js` should look like this

``` jsx title='src/data/txLegos/millionTX.js'
import { buildMultiTxAction } from '../../utils/legos';
import { CONTRACTS } from '../contracts';
// highlight-next-line
import { DETAILS } from '../details';

export const MILLION_TX = {
  SUMMON_TOKEN: buildMultiTxAction({
    actions: [
      {
        targetContract: '.contextData.chainConfig.erc20_summon',
        abi: CONTRACTS.ERC_20_SUMMON,
        fnName: 'summonToken',
        // highlight-start
        args: [
          '1000000000000000000000000',
          '.values.tokenName',
          '.values.tokenSymbol',
          '.values.selectedSafeAddress',
        ],
        // highlight-end
      },
    ],
    // highlight-next-line
    detailsToJSON: DETAILS.MILLION,
  }),
};
```

## 3.4 Import the MILLION_TX object into `src/txLegos/contractTX.js`

First, add the following code to import the `MILLION_TX` object. 
```jsx
import { MILLION_TX } from './millionTX';
```

Next, add 
```jsx
...MILLION_TX,
``` 
to the `TX` object in `src/txLegos/contractTX.js`. 

Once this step is complete, you are ready to test your transaction to mint a million tokens.

Navigate to your Proposals and submit a Mint a Million Proposal to test your Boost!


# 4. Submit a PR to the [daohaus-app repository]((https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app))

When you've completed your Mint a Million Boost, submit a Pull Request with your own branch ```mint_a_million_<yourdiscordhandle>```. We'd love to check out what you've built and reach out for any support or feedback. 

You are now ready to create a Boost to interact with any external smart contracts - just swap out the contracts and fields you used above! If you are building a custom boost, please reach out to `@arentweall` + `@ui369` on the [DAOhaus Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/daohaus) and we'd love to provide developer support for your Boost!
