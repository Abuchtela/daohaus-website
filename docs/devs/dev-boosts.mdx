As a recap, Boosts are custom proposal types that enable Moloch DAOs to interact with external smart contracts (via Minions) or off-chain APIs. Developers can work with "code legos" such as custom field inputs, form layouts and transaction payloads to create these Boosts

If you are a developer thinking of building a Boost, you will need to assemble the following 3 categories of code legos
1. **Playlists, forms and fields**: This renders the proposal forms and fields for proposal submission.  
2. **Contracts and ABIs**: This stores the contracts and ABI calls that power your use cases. 
3. **Transactions**: This prepares the transaction schemas that are required for the smart contract calls.

The following sections will cover the essential code legos fpr the above 3 areas. For a more in-depth tutorial, please refer to link [here](https://daohaus.club/docs/devs/build-a-boost)

## Playlists, Forms and Fields 
> In this section, we will observe how `playlists.js`, `forms.js`, `fields.js`, `details.js`, `publishers.js`, `proposalUtils.jsx` and your custom Form JS file work together to render forms and fields for DAOhaus users to create, fill in and submit proposals. 

[**playlists.js**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/bf28463c835d69ad0a85bde432d0d873622ac314/src/data/playlists.js)

Playlists are folders or groups of related or similar Boosts (i.e. custom proposal forms). This is managed by `playlists.js`- a central directory of all Boost Playlists. 

Within the `BOOST_PLAYLISTS` object, there is an object for each Boost Playlist with `name`, `id`, and `forms` (for each proposal in the playlist).

**Your custom Form JS file** 

To create your custom proposal form, you are required to create a JS file which builds the form for your specific proposal. A sample would be the [mintAMillionForms.js](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/9698ba8a9535f7b85f84553aa6defb9181604f44/src/data/formLegos/mintAMillionForms.js). 

Your JS file will import existing and reusable fields from `fields.js`, while adding in custom fields required for your contract.

[**forms.js**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/develop/src/data/formLegos/forms.js)

`forms.js` is a central directory of all forms in the DAOhaus app. You will need to import the object from your custom Form JS file into `forms.js` 

[**fields.js**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/develop/src/data/fields.js)

`fields.js` is a central directory of common fields created for the DAOhaus app, such as Proposal Title, Minion Select, etc. These are meant to be re-usable within the DAOhaus app, when creating new forms. Most developers will import these reusable fields when assembling your custom Forms JS file. 

[**details.js**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/develop/src/data/details.js)

`details.js` is a central directory of proposal details for all proposal types in the DAOhaus app, such as Proposal Title, Description, Link, Proposal Type, etc. 

[**publishers.js**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/develop/src/data/publishers.js)

`publishers.js` is a central directory of all Boost publishers in the DAOhaus ecosystem. This will be used in the `boosts.js` file. You will only need to add yourself to the list, when you are building your first boost. 

[**proposalUtils.jsx**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/develop/src/utils/proposalUtils.jsx) 

`proposalUtils.js` is a central directory of all proposal utilities, such as Proposal Types. These proposal utilities are imported to empower Proposal functionalities throughout the DAOhaus app. 

## Contracts and ABIs
> In this section, we will observe how `contracts.js`, `abi.js` and `chain.js` and your custom contract ABI JSON file work together to store contract information necessary for making smart contract calls.

[**contracts.js**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/develop/src/data/contracts.js)

**Your custom contract JSON**

You will need to create a custom JSON file that contains the ABIs for your contract. This will be used when making calls to your smart contract. A sample would be [erc20Summon.json](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/9698ba8a9535f7b85f84553aa6defb9181604f44/src/contracts/erc20Summon.json)

`contracts.js` is a central directory of all contract addresses, including properties such as `location`, `abiName` and `contractAddress`. This tells the app where to locate contract-related information when making a smart contract call. You will need to import and add your object into `contracts.js` file.

[**abi.js**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/develop/src/utils/abi.js) 

`abi.js` is a central directory of all contract ABIs that will be used in the DAOhaus app. You will need to import the JSON file (containing your contract ABIs) and add it to the LOCAL_ABI object. 

[**chain.js**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/develop/src/utils/chain.js) 

`chain.js` is a central directory of all contract addresses on all chains where DAOhaus is deployed on. You will need to add the contract address for the chain which your contract is deployed on. 

## Transactions 

> In this section, we will observe how `contractTX.js` and your custom TX JS file work together to build a transaction for smart contract calls. 

**Your custom TX js** 

You will need to create a custom TX file that contains the actions and arguments required to build the transaction and contract call. A sample would be [millionTx.js](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/9698ba8a9535f7b85f84553aa6defb9181604f44/src/data/txLegos/millionTX.js)

[**contractTX.js**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/blob/develop/src/data/txLegos/contractTX.js) 

`contractTX.js` is a central directory of all tranasction types, which the DAOhaus transaction builder will build for. You will need to import the object from your custom TX js file here.
