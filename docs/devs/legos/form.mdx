## How it all comes together

Form Legos compose txLegos and fieldLegos.

#### Form Example

```js
  MEMBER: {
    id: 'MEMBER',
    title: 'Membership Proposal',
    description: 'Proposal for DAO membership',
    type: PROPOSAL_TYPES.MEMBER,
    required: ['title', 'sharesRequested'], // Use name key from proposal type object
    tx: TX.SUBMIT_PROPOSAL,
    fields: [
      [FIELD.TITLE, FIELD.DESCRIPTION, FIELD.LINK],
      [FIELD.SHARES_REQUEST, FIELD.TRIBUTE],
    ],
    additionalOptions: [
      {
        ...FIELD.APPLICANT,
        label: 'Applicant',
      },
      FIELD.LOOT_REQUEST,
      FIELD.PAYMENT_REQUEST,
    ],
    customValidations: ['nonDaoApplicant'],
  }
```

This blueprint does a few things:

- It handles some basic data about the form.
- It takes in a `txlego` to handle contract execution when the form submits.
- It handles validation for what fields are required.
- It also orchestrates the fields that appear on the form, in order.

#### id

(STRING)

Unique identifier for the form lego.

#### title

(STRING)

Sets the title that appears at the top of the form.

(STRING)

#### required

(ARRAY OF STRINGS)

Takes an array of field.name(s).

Before the proposal submits, it will iterate over this array and search for all the keys in the `values` object. If any of these values are falsy, it will stop the transaction and return an error for each required field where the conditions have not been met.

**Important:** Make sure to use the value that is found in the field's `name` key. Otherwise the form will not submit.

#### tx

(TX LEGO)

Recieves a TX lego. This is the transaction that will be fired when the form submits.

If tx is empty, the form will throw an exception on submit.

Takes in an array of Field data and the factory component renders these in order. Throws an exception if it doesn't find a field component for each field.type.
