# Boosts 

Boosts are functionality added by developers to expand functionality beyond the default. 

> If you are new to Boosts, please refer to the [Boosts 101](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/boosts/boosts)

The most common types of Boost are custom proposals forms. Custom field inputs, form layouts and transaction payloads introduce added functionalities to Moloch DAOs. These Boosts can interact with external smart contracts (via Minions) or off-chain APIs, allowing for a wide range of use cases to be built.

Developers are able to publish these Boosts on the Boosts Marketplace for DAOs to install and access these functionality. Once a Boost is installed, the DAO is able to create, vote and execute the custom proposal based on the developer's customizations.
