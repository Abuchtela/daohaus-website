# Boosts 

Boosts are functionality added by developers to expand DAOhaus functionality beyond the default.

The most common types of Boost are custom proposals forms. Custom field inputs, form layouts and transaction payloads introduce added functionalities to the DAOhaus app. 

Boosts can interact with external smart contracts (via Minions) or off-chain APIs, allowing for a wide range of use cases to be built.

Developers are able to publish these Boosts on the [Boosts Marketplace](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/boosts/installing-boosts) for DAOs to install and access new functionality. 

When you activate a Boost for your DAO, members will be able to create, vote and execute a new custom proposal type.
