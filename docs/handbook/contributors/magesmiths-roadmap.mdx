After weeks of planning & alignment, this is the Product Roadmap for the Magesmiths from March to June 2022. 

<details>
    <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è How to read the table</summary>

The **Focus** areas are prioritised in the following manner: 
- üü¢ Must-haves: Today, we‚Äôre devoting resources towards them  
- üü° Should-haves: We‚Äôre allocating future resources to them
- üü† Good-to-have: No explicit resource allocations today

The **Phases** are split in the following manner
- **Rage** is a research phase dedicated to experimental projects. Uses short-term development and a disciplined approach to experiment design.  
- **Sage** phase is dedicated to designing and building the app (and DAO tools) using Team Rage‚Äôs data. The teams here are more fully-form Product Squads (Dev, Design, PM) who prize long-term thinking, focus, and quality control above all else.

First, this chart lays out our prioritized workstreams along with timelines and Rage / Sage phases. The timelines here are subject to change.

Certain roles (orange cells) are still open, so if you are keen to contribute, please reach out to the workstream teams. 
> *The Decentralyst (Decentralization Analyst) role is required to create documentation and resources on our current project management and decentralization practices.
